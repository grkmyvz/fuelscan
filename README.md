# FuelScan - Testnet Beta 3

I prepared this project to improve myself. I also released it on "Vercel". [FuelScan Web](https://fuelscan-gamma.vercel.app/).

## Project Setup

Download the repo first.

### `git clone git@github.com:grkmyvz/fuelscan.git`

> Typescript must be installed globally on your computer. `yarn global add typescript`

Open a terminal in the home directory. Change to the fuel-provider directory with the `cd packages/fuel-provider` command and run the `tsc` command.

Go back to home directory and install packages with `yarn install`.

And the project is ready. You can now use your project locally with the `yarn start` command.
